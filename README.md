# Word Portrait

I love to read fiction. I've always wondered how good writers distinguish themselves from other writers. Over time, I realized that if a 
writer can made me care about a character, care about their future, their life and their choices, then they've made me care about their 
book. I wondered how writers are able to bring characters to life. What makes them multidimensional or personal? 

I conducted one such analysis but visualizing the frequency of every word in my favorite book growing up, "Clockwork Angel" by Cassaandra Clare.
